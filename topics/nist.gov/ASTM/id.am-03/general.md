Data flow diagrams help an organization understand the  expected behavior of its networks and business processes. This understanding can help with troubleshooting, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and response and recovery activities. Software tools can assist in creating these diagrams by automating discovery of interconnections between networked devices, corporate networks, and  external connections. Understanding these relationships is critical for security control implementation and network monitoring.

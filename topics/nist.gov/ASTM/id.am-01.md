# Additive Manufacturing Guidance
A physical inventory for AM systems should include each machine's configuration including any optional components/features as well as supporting equipment such as sensors/monitoring setups, and instruments/tools used for configuring/calibrating the system. Further, any physical components that may be reused/recycled in the process should be tracked along with their process history (temperature, specific builds, post processing, etc.). For example, material left in a machine may be degraded by sitting at an elevated temperature for an extended period outside of fabrication. If confidentiality is a concern, the waste stream should also be tracked. As a forensic example, a discarded build surface can contain information about part geometry or process settings that may be sensitive.

In the context of additive manufacturing, it is critical to manage PII, PHI, and IP information when stored in standardized or proprietary data formats due to the personalization of parts and the distribution of workflows. Through continuous discovery, analysis, and classification of data and corresponding metadata, designated data types can be identified, managed, and aligned with organizational risk strategies. In addition, tracking data provenance, ownership, and geolocation within additive workflows is essential for identifying and documenting the location of critical parts, authorized user access, and where additive manufacturing data is processed and stored. Furthermore, the integrity of data needs to be maintained throughout the lifecycle of an additive part, and in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and organizational policies.

In the context of additive manufacturing, it is critical to manage PII, PHI, and IP information when stored in standardized or proprietary data formats due to the personalization of parts and the distribution of workflows. Through continuous discovery, analysis, and classification of data and corresponding metadata, designated data types can be identified, managed, and aligned with organizational risk strategies. In addition, tracking data provenance, ownership, and geolocation within distributed workflows is essential for identifying and documenting the location of critical information, authorized user access, and changes to where data is processed and stored. Enterprise and process workflows must maintain data compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and organizational policies throughout the data lifecycle.

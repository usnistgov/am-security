A software inventory catalogs the origin, components, location, use, maintenance status, update policy, and responsible party of each software deployment within the AM workflow. Because software is a significant part of any system’s attack surface, this inventory provides an important source of information when assessing security risks, defining security policy, and responding to incidents. Depending on the environment, representative entries for the AM context might list CAD/CAM applications, toolpath generators (i.e. slicers, etc.), device firmware, operating systems, data storage, process simulation, job management, and QC software, among others. Users will add a new inventory entry for each new piece of software that is deployed into the workflow. Asset identification tools and vendor SBOMs will inform this initial entry, while periodic automated scans and audits will ensure entry’s accuracy through regular updates. The inventory should interface with the data flow diagrams in ID.AM-3 to yield a complete account of the AM workflow’s communication.

Keep track of the various third-party components, materials, equipment, 
and software used in the additive manufacturing process. Maintain a 
comprehensive inventory of supplier services such as material models, 
printer parts, software licenses, cloud services, e-commerce, system of 
records, and any other resources essential to the additive 
manufacturing workflow. Also, retain information and maintain records 
about suppliers to ensure traceability, quality control, and effective 
supply chain management in additive manufacturing operations. By 
cataloging external resources, organizations involved in additive 
manufacturing can enhance their asset management practices and maintain 
greater visibility and control over their production cycles.

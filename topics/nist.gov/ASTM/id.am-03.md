# Additive Manufacturing Guidance
Data flow diagrams enable a manufacturer to understand the flow of data between 
networked components. Documenting data flows enables organizations to understand 
expected behavior of their networks. This understanding of how devices 
communicate assists with troubleshooting as well as response and recovery 
activities. This information can be leveraged during forensic activities or used 
for analysis to identify anomalies.
Data flow diagrams for AM processes represent not only the flow of data between 
networked components, but also relationships between data elements and their 
impacts on printed parts. AM provides more freedom in design complexity than 
other manufacturing technologies. Therefore, AM processes are heavily 
data-driven. Examples of AM data elements that can be manipulated to adversely 
affect the manufacturing process include CAD geometry data, material 
specifications, AM machine function specifications, and process parameters such 
as layer thickness and infill pattern. Examples of adverse impacts include 
porosity, tensile strength, anisotropy, surface roughness, and geometric and 
dimensional inaccuracy.

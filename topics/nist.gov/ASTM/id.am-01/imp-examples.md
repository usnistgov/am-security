<!-- we might want to group h/w into buckets base on functionality -->
<!-- Concrete AM-specific examples: AM machine, controller, HMI, sensors not part of the machine itself, environmental sensors. Question: what is in the system vs. external to the system?
Joel: boundary between IT and OT is more topological than functional. E.g., HMI is an IT workstation but it is part of OT in that it is on the OT subnet. "Examples of AM h/w include..." -->

1.  Maintain inventories for additive manufacturing machines, controller workstation, pre-
processing, 
co-processing, and post-processing hardware. Examples include material drying and feedstock 
testing (for pre), in-process sensing, filtration/recirculation hardware (co), depowdering, heat treatment, 
machining, NDE (for post). NDE can also be leveraged as a co-process.

2.  Constantly monitor networks to detect new hardware and automatically update 
inventories

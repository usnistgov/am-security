1. Maintain a list of the designated data types of concern to additive manufacturers 
    Examples include but are not limited to 
   * Computer-aided design data
   * 3D data formats such as STL and AMF
   * Data formats for downstream processing steps such as slicing specifications and G-code
   * Process parameters
   * PII and PHI included in the part specification 

2. Continuously discover and analyze ad hoc data to identify new instances 
   of designated data types <!-- additive-specific examples? -->

3. Assign data classifications to designated data types through tags or 
   labels <!-- additive-specific examples? -->

4. Track data provenance, ownership, and geolocation within additive workflows 
to identify and document the location of critical parts and where additive manufacturing 
data is processed

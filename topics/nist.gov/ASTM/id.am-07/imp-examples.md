1. Maintain a list of the designated data types of concern to additive manufacturers 
    Examples include but are not limited to 
   * Computer-aided design data
   * 3D data formats such as STL and AMF
   * Data formats for downstream processing steps such as slicing specifications and G-code
   * Process parameters

2. Classify data types by mapping them to the F3490 common dictionary, and whether they may contain PII.
   For example, an ISO 10303 CAD file could contain PII, but the STL format lacks the ability to specify metadata that could be PII.

3. Continuously discover and analyze ad hoc data to identify new instances 
   of designated data types 

   <!-- The following examples should be dropped unless we 
   can make them more additive-specific 
   
   5. Track data provenance, ownership, and geolocation within additive workflows 
   to identify and document the location of critical parts and where additive manufacturing 
   data is processed  -->

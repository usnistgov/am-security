To facilitate configuration management, additive manufacturing data inventories should be aligned where practical with the 
common dictionary specified in ASTM F3490. Additively manufactured products can have 
arbitrarily complex designs that may be customized for specific individuals. For example, 
CAD data for an additively manufactured prosthesis 
might contain personally identifiable 
information (PII) or protected health information (PHI). Therefore, organizations should maintain data 
inventories of PII and PHI.

Data flow diagrams help a manufacturer understand the flow of data between networked components. Documenting data flows enables organizations to understand the expected behavior of their networks. This understanding of how devices communicate assists with troubleshooting as well as response and recovery activities. This information can be leveraged during forensic activities or used for analysis to identify anomalies.

Organizations should consider the impact of the use of automated data flow mapping tools that use active scanning or require network monitoring tools (e.g., in-line network probes) on OT systems. Impacts could be due to the nature of the information, the volume of network traffic, or the momentary disconnection of manufacturing system components from the network. Consider using data flow mapping tools that utilize these methods during planned downtime.

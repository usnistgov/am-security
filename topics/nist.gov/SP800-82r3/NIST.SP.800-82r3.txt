Abstract 
This document provides guidance on how to secure operational technology (OT) while addressing their unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems. The document provides an overview of OT and typical system topologies, identifies common threats and vulnerabilities to these systems, and provides recommended security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks. 
Keywords 
computer security; distributed control systems (DCS); industrial control systems (ICS); information security; network security; operational technology (OT); programmable logic controllers (PLC); risk management; security controls; supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. 
Reports on Computer Systems Technology 
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, government, and academic organizations. 
Note to Readers 
This document is the third revision of NIST SP 800-82. Updates in this revision include: • Expansion in scope from industrial control systems to operational technology (OT) • Updates to OT threats and vulnerabilities • Updates to OT risk management, recommended practices, and architectures • Updates to current activities in OT security • Updates to security capabilities and tools for OT • Additional alignment with other OT security standards and guidelines, including the Cybersecurity Framework • New tailoring guidance for NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 security controls • An OT overlay for NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5 security controls that provides tailored security control baselines for low-, moderate-, and high-impact OT systems

Executive Summary 
This document provides guidance for establishing secure operational technology (OT)1
1 See https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/operational-technology-security.   while addressing OT’s unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. OT encompasses a broad range of programmable systems and devices that interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that interact with the physical environment). These systems and devices detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or control of devices, processes, and events. Examples include industrial control systems (ICS), building automation systems, transportation systems, physical access control systems, physical environment monitoring systems, and physical environment measurement systems. This document provides an overview of OT and typical system topologies, identifies common threats and vulnerabilities to these systems, and recommends security countermeasures to mitigate the associated risks. 

OT is vital to the operation of U.S. critical infrastructures, which are often highly interconnected, mutually dependent systems. It is important to note that while federal agencies operate many of the Nation’s critical infrastructures, many others are privately owned and operated. Additionally, critical infrastructures are often referred to as a “system of systems” because of the interdependencies that exist between various industrial sectors and interconnections between business partners. Initially, OT had little resemblance to traditional information technology (IT) systems because OT systems were isolated, ran proprietary control protocols, and used specialized hardware and software. As OT systems adopt IT solutions to enable corporate business systems connectivity and remote access capabilities and are designed and implemented using industry-standard computers, operating systems (OSs), and network protocols, they have begun to resemble IT systems. This integration supports new IT capabilities, but it provides significantly less isolation for OT from the outside world than predecessor systems, creating a greater need to secure OT systems. The increasing use of wireless networking places OT implementations at greater risk from adversaries who are in relatively close physical proximity but do not have direct physical access to the equipment. While security solutions have been designed to deal with these issues in typical IT systems, special precautions must be taken when introducing these same solutions to OT environments. In some cases, new security solutions that are tailored to the OT environment are needed.  Although some characteristics are similar, OT also has characteristics that differ from traditional information processing systems. Many of these differences stem from the fact that logic executing in OT has a direct effect on the physical world. Some of these characteristics include significant risk to the health and safety of human lives, serious damage to the environment, and severe financial issues, such as production losses, negative impacts to the Nation’s economy, and the compromise of proprietary information. OT has unique performance and reliability requirements and often uses OSs and applications that may be considered unconventional to typical IT personnel. Furthermore, the goals of safety and efficiency sometimes conflict with security in the design and operation of OT systems. 
OT cybersecurity programs should always be part of broader OT safety and reliability programs at both industrial sites and enterprise cybersecurity programs because cybersecurity is essential to the safe and reliable operation of modern industrial processes. Threats to OT systems can come from numerous sources, including hostile governments, terrorist groups, disgruntled employees, malicious intruders, complexities, natural disasters, malicious actions by insiders, and unintentional actions such human error or failure to follow established policies and procedures. OT security objectives typically prioritize integrity and availability, followed by confidentiality, but also must consider safety as an overarching priority. Possible incidents that an OT system may face include: • Blocked or delayed flow of information through OT networks, which could disrupt OT operation, including loss of view and loss of control • Unauthorized changes to instructions, commands, or alarm thresholds that could damage, disable, or shut down equipment, create environmental impacts, and/or endanger human life • Inaccurate information sent to system operators, either to disguise unauthorized changes or to cause operators to initiate inappropriate actions that could have various negative effects • Modified OT software or configuration settings or OT software infected with malware, which could have various negative effects • Interference with the operation of equipment protection systems, which could endanger costly and difficult-to-replace equipment • Interference with the operation of safety systems, which could endanger human life Major security objectives for an OT implementation should include the following: • Restrict logical access to the OT network, network activity, and systems. This may include using unidirectional gateways, utilizing a demilitarized zone (DMZ) network architecture with firewalls to prevent network traffic from passing directly between the corporate and OT networks, and having separate authentication mechanisms and credentials for users of the corporate and OT networks. The OT system should also use a network topology that has multiple layers, with the most critical communications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer. • Restrict physical access to the OT network and devices. Unauthorized physical access to components can seriously disrupt the OT’s functionality. A combination of physical access controls should be used, such as locks, card readers, and/or guards. • Protect individual OT components from exploitation. This includes deploying security patches in as expeditious a manner as possible after testing them under field conditions, disabling all unused ports and services and ensuring that they remain disabled, restricting OT user privileges to only those that are required for each user’s role, tracking and monitoring audit trails, and using security controls such as antivirus software and file integrity checking software where technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and mitigate malware. Keys of OT assets like programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and 
safety systems should be in the “Run” position at all times unless they are being actively programmed. • Restrict unauthorized modification of data. This includes data in all states (e.g., at rest, in transit, in use) including data flows crossing network boundaries.  • Detect security events and incidents. Detecting security events that have not yet escalated into incidents can help defenders break the attack chain before attackers attain their objectives. This includes the capability to detect failed OT components, unavailable services, and exhausted resources that are important to provide proper and safe functioning of the OT system. • Maintain functionality during adverse conditions. This involves designing the OT system with the ability to ensure delivery of critical operations through disruption. Critical components should have a redundant counterpart. Additionally, if a component fails, it should fail in a manner that does not generate unnecessary traffic on the OT or other networks nor causes another problem elsewhere, such as a cascading event. The OT system should also allow for graceful degradation, such as moving from “normal operation” with full automation to “emergency operation” with operators more involved and less automation to “manual operation” with no automation. • Restore and recover the system after an incident. Incidents are inevitable, and an incident response plan is essential. A major characteristic of a good security program is how quickly the system can be recovered after an incident has occurred. A cross-functional cybersecurity team can share their varied domain knowledge and experience to evaluate and mitigate risks to the OT system. At a minimum, the cybersecurity team should consist of a member of the organization’s IT staff, a control engineer, a control system operator, a network and system security expert, a member of the management staff, and a member of the physical security department. For continuity and completeness, the cybersecurity team should consult with the control system vendor and/or system integrator as well. The cybersecurity team should coordinate closely with site management (e.g., facility superintendent) and the company’s Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Security Officer (CSO), who – along with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or Chief Operating Officer (COO) – accepts complete responsibility and accountability for the cybersecurity of the OT system and for any safety incidents, reliability incidents, or equipment damage caused directly or indirectly by cyber incidents. An effective cybersecurity program for an OT system should apply a strategy known as “defense in depth,” while calls for layering security mechanisms such that the impact of a failure in any one mechanism is minimized. Organizations should not rely on “security by obscurity.” In a typical OT system, a defense-in-depth strategy includes: • Developing security policies, procedures, training, and educational material that apply specifically to the OT system • Considering OT security policies and procedures based on the National Terrorism Advisory System and deploying increasingly heightened security postures as the Threat Level increases • Addressing security throughout the life cycle of the OT system, including architecture design, procurement, installation, operations, maintenance, and decommissioning 





• Implementing a network topology for the OT system that has multiple layers, with the most critical communications occurring in the most secure and reliable layer • Providing logical separation between the corporate and OT networks (e.g., stateful inspection firewalls between the networks, unidirectional gateways) • Considering where physical separation may be required as opposed to logical separation • Employing a DMZ network architecture (e.g., prevent direct traffic between the corporate and OT networks) • Using multi-factor authentication for remote access to the OT system • Ensuring that critical components are redundant and are on redundant networks • Designing critical systems for graceful degradation (fault tolerant) to prevent catastrophic cascading events • Disabling unused ports and services on OT devices after testing to ensure that this will not impact OT operation • Restricting physical access to the OT network and devices • Restricting OT user privileges to only those that are required to perform each user’s function (e.g., establishing role-based access control, configuring each role based on the principle of least privilege) • Using separate authentication mechanisms and credentials for users of the OT network and the corporate network (i.e., OT network accounts do not use corporate network user accounts) • Using modern technology, such as smart cards for user authentication • Implementing security controls (e.g., intrusion detection software, antivirus software, file integrity checking software) where technically feasible to prevent, deter, detect, and mitigate the introduction, exposure, and propagation of malicious software to, within, and from the OT system • Applying security techniques, such as encryption and/or cryptographic hashes, to OT data storage and communications where appropriate • Expeditiously deploying security patches after testing all patches under field conditions on a test system, if possible, before installation on the OT system • Tracking and monitoring audit trails on critical areas of the OT system • Employing reliable and secure network protocols and services where feasible

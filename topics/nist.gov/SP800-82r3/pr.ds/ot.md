<!-- Some of these could be implementation examples -->

Identify critical physical and electronic file types and data to protect while at rest. This may include personally identifiable information and sensitive, proprietary, or trade secret information (e.g., PLC program code, robot programs, computer-aided drafting (CAD) or computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) files, operating manuals and documentation, electrical diagrams, network diagrams, historical production data. Organizations should consider centralizing critical data within secure storage locations.

When OT data is stored in the cloud or on vendor servers, organizations should consider performing a risk analysis to determine how the data is protected by the service provider and whether additional countermeasures should be implemented to manage risk to an acceptable level.

Monitor information flows from the OT security domain to other security domains and connections between security domains. Technologies such as data diodes, firewalls, and ACLs can be used to restrict the information flow. Examples of critical interfaces and interconnections may include interfaces between IT and OT, OT and external industry partners, or OT and third-party support vendors.

To protect data on system components at end of life, an asset disposal program should be implemented, including considerations for wiping, sanitizing, or otherwise destroying critical data and media prior to disposal. The asset disposal program should include any removable media, mobile devices, and traditional OT hardware.

Inventories of services provided by suppliers are maintained

## Additive Manufacturing Guidance{.section .additive}
Keep track of the various third-party components, materials, equipment, 
and software used in the additive manufacturing process. Maintain a 
comprehensive inventory of supplier services such as material models, 
printer parts, software licenses, cloud services, e-commerce, system of 
records, and any other resources essential to the additive 
manufacturing workflow. Also, retain information and maintain records 
about suppliers to ensure traceability, quality control, and effective 
supply chain management in additive manufacturing operations. By 
cataloging external resources, organizations involved in additive 
manufacturing can enhance their asset management practices and maintain 
greater visibility and control over their production cycles.

### {.example .ex}
Inventory all external services used by the organization, including 
third-party infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service 
(PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings; APIs; and other 
externally hosted application services.

### {.example .ex}
Update the inventory when a new external service is going to be 
utilized to ensure adequate cybersecurity risk management monitoring of 
the organization's use of that service
